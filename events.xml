<description>We're looking for seasoned speakers, willing to share their experience and knowledge to help new and old stars to build better presentations. Potential topics could include but are not limited to:

- designing session flows
- turning a slide deck into a presentation
- accessible presentations
- inclusive language
- or how to pre-record a session.
Our goal is to build a free content library that’s available to everyone to help them improve their sessions – no matter if it’s their first or 100th, even though we think new speakers will benefit the most.</description>
